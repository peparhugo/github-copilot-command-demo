# Imported skills

This repository vendors skill packs under the `skills/` folder, based on GitHub Copilot skill conventions:

- `skills/anthropics/*` copied from `anthropics/skills` (`main` branch)
- `skills/awesome-copilot/*` copied from `github/awesome-copilot` (`main` branch)
- `skills/dbt-labs/*` copied from `dbt-labs/dbt-agent-skills` (`main` branch)

These are organized by source to keep provenance clear and avoid naming collisions between packs.

Binary artifacts from upstream (e.g., `.ttf`, `.pdf`, `.tar.gz`) are intentionally excluded from this repository copy.
