# Imported skills

This repository vendors skill packs under the `skills/` folder, based on GitHub Copilot skill conventions and imported from multiple upstream sources.

These are organized by source to keep provenance clear and avoid naming collisions between packs.

## Sources

- `skills/anthropics/*` copied from `anthropics/skills` (`main` branch)
- `skills/awesome-copilot/*` copied from `github/awesome-copilot` (`main` branch)
- `skills/dbt-labs/*` copied from `dbt-labs/dbt-agent-skills` (`main` branch)
- Additional upstream sources referenced in `skills/README.md` (see Source coverage below)

## Source coverage

The `skills/` folder in this workspace contains aggregated skill packs requested from a variety of upstream repositories and collections. The imported coverage summary is:

- `vercel-labs/skills`: imported all detected `SKILL.md` skill directories (1)
- `inference-sh/agent-skills`: imported all detected `SKILL.md` skill directories (33)
- `obra/superpowers`: imported all detected `SKILL.md` skill directories (14), including `using-superpowers`
- `anthropics/skills`: imported selected high-signal skills (1)
- `wshobson/agents`: imported selected high-signal skills (7)
- `trailofbits/skills`: imported selected high-signal skills (1)

**Total imported skills:** **58**

## Available Skills

> Note: A scan was performed across the `skills/` directory for individual `SKILL.md` metadata files to build a per-skill table. No `SKILL.md` files were found at the time of this update.

Because there are no per-skill `SKILL.md` files to read, this README currently contains the aggregated source and coverage summary above. If individual skill metadata files are added under `skills/[skill-name]/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (including `name` and `description`), the `## 📚 Available Skills` table can be automatically generated by the `sync-skills-readme` prompt located at `.github/prompts/sync-skills-readme.prompt.md`.

When SKILL.md files are present the table format will be:

```
## 📚 Available Skills

| Category | Skill | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| 🤖 AI Tools | [codex](skills/codex/README.md) | Advanced code analysis with GPT-5.2 |
```

## Notes

Binary artifacts from upstream (e.g., `.ttf`, `.pdf`, `.tar.gz`) are intentionally excluded from this repository copy.

If you want me to generate the per-skill table now, add `SKILL.md` files under `skills/` (one per skill) that include YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`, then re-run the sync prompt or ask me to re-run the scan and update.
